Create an HTML page that has a header 150px high, a sidebar 24% of the screen wide, and a main container to display a Leaflet map.

The results from this HTTP request will contain an array of elements from OpenStreetMap:
http://www.overpass-api.de/api/interpreter?data=[out:json][timeout:25];(nwr["amenity"="recycling"](51.0345,0.8212,51.4198,1.4845););out body;>;out skel qt;

There are two types of elements: Nodes and Ways. Nodes have geographical coordinates and are represented in the Leaflet map as markers. Ways have a list of Nodes whose coordinates are used to plot the way as a Path in the Leaflet map. I've included samples json structures of the types of elements we'll be working with.

Some of the elements have tags. Elements with an element.tag.amenity equal to "recycling" represents a recycling station. Nodes and Ways can be recycling stations.

If elements have an element.tags.name, use the name on the elements Leaflet object as a Popup when a user clicks on it. If there is no element.tags.name then use "Recycling station" as the name.

If elements have tags beginning with "recycling:" extract all the text after the colon, add them to an array and remove all duplicates. For example, from the element.tag "recycling:clothes" extract "clothes". Next create a set of checkboxes in the sidebar that will be used to control which of the recycling stations to show on the map. For example, if I check the checkbox for "clothes", all the recycling stations with the element.tags.recycling:clothes equal to "yes" should be displayed.

Lastly, on each recycling stations Leaflet Popup with the name, display each of the accepted recycling types (element.tags.recycling:*=Yes).

This is the structure of a simple node element with geographical coordinates:
        {
            "type": "node",
            "id": 4988311615,
            "lat": 51.3044935,
            "lon": 0.8931273
        }
        

This is the structure of a node element, with recycling tags, indicating a recycling station:
        {
            "type": "node",
            "id": 10969114210,
            "lat": 51.2558348,
            "lon": 1.0189379,
            "tags": {
                "amenity": "recycling",
                "colour": "blue",
                "recycling:clothes": "yes",
                "recycling:shoes": "yes",
                "recycling_type": "container"
            }
        }

And this is the structure of a way element, also representing a recycling station. Note the element.nodes which contains the nodes, and therefore, coordinates to plot in the Path:
        {
            "type": "way",
            "id": 863158381,
            "nodes": [

                8040943004,
                8040943005,
                8040943006,
                8040943007,
                8040943008,
                8040942997
            ],
            "tags": {
                "amenity": "recycling",
                "name": "Canterbury Household Waste Recycling Centre",

                "ownership": "municipal",
                "recycling:batteries": "yes",
                "recycling:cans": "yes",
                "recycling:cardboard": "yes",
